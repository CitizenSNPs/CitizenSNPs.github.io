In my time as a data analyst, I've had experience leading a few software validation projects. My experience mostly involves work with validating feature integration for Illumina's DNA Preparation System (DPS) LIMS system. Working with Software Development and QA, I have successfully validated a few versions DPS, as well as the integration of one of Illumina's newest QC softwares, Rematch, allowing us to track any discrepencies/nonconformances surrounding matched DNA samples. While working on these projects, I worked with QA/DevOps/our process engineers to create a Design & Development Plan, analyszing the risks and benefits of intorducing new software to our QC pipeline. 

I have experience revising SOPs and writing validation plans, creating pass/fail conditions via test cases (JIRA), and --- conditions via a validation report. 

My experience lies primarily in creating manual tests to provide a positive user experience by ensuring overall usability. From this, we can see what parts of the process can be improved, and ensure functionality. We then gain test protocol feedback by creating several pass/fail conditions, then deliver this feedback via a validation report which passes through an interdepartmental team via several review cycles.
