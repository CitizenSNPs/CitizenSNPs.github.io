In my time as a data analyst, I've had experience leading a few software validation projects. My experience mostly involves work with validating feature integration for Illumina's DNA Preparation System (DPS) LIMS system. Working with Software Development and QA, I have successfully validated a few versions DPS, as well as the integration of one of Illumina's newest QC softwares, Rematch, allowing us to track any discrepencies/nonconformances surrounding matched DNA samples. While working on these projects, I worked with QA/DevOps/our process engineers to create a Design & Development Plan, analyszing the risks and benefits of intorducing new software to our QC pipeline. 

I have experience revising SOPs and writing validation plans, creating pass/fail conditions via test cases (JIRA), and --- conditions via a validation report.
