## Data Analytics

### Lab Metrics and QC

**What is this?** With the introduction of Ancestry DNA Health and a large scale-up in manufacturing throughput, a small team was put together to validate new metrics, investigate lab anomolies, and to track the overall health and quality of our laboratory operations. Welcome to my dashboard. In my experience working with both the front and backends of lab management, I've been afforded the opportunity to implemenent new processes, introduce new equipment, design new quality standards, and developing new validation protocols to the company's existing manufacturing workflows and SOPs.

**Why?** Clinical solutions! New workflows mean new quality metrics. Introduction of a new clinical assay means it's time to dive deeper into any existing quality control metrics to see what new quality standards our inplace lab processes may need. Nonconformances provide a basis for further data collection and standard investigations.


### Dashboards

I attended WeWork's <i>Intermediate/Advanced Tableau Visualization Training</i> in 2019. Take a look at some of my work:

**Project description:** Below are examples of data mining using Python, R, T-SQL, and Tableau to rank nonconformances among different laboratory conditions. Python was used to group affected sample batches and map them to each experimental condition using Pandas and Scikit-learn. Grouped data were then tested for concordance and mapped to several equipment run conditions.
