In my time as an Automation Engineer, I took on managing the DevOps of a large LIMS application. The aim of the application was to handle data migration from the Illumina sequencers to and from the company's isilon spaces; this involved setting up the DevOps environment (Rancher 2.x), setting up virtual nodes, and migrating previous data to the new Rancher environment. This way, I could migrate old data and connect lab users to their respective projects by migrating old data to the new environment. One of the largest scoped projects of my career was replacing this application with a new LIMS. This involved leading a large interdepartmental team of subject matter experts to choose a platform, create user & software requirements, and lead in a year and a half long software procurement initiative.
