Working in lab management, I had the benefit of managing, automating, and working with a host of laboratory equipment. My experience includes, but is not limited to, Tecan EVO, Hamilton Star, Cybio FeliX, and the Agilent 2100 BioAnalyzer. I've attended onsite liquid-handling training for the Hamilton STAR, STARlet, and STARplus, as well as online training for the TecanEVO. I have experience scripting several microarray assays, including Illumina's Infinium and pharmacogenetics assays on both the Tecan and Hamilton STAR. My process includes buidling requirements to fit the needs of lab users. This invlolves quite a bit of offline testing and parameter tracking. I create a deck layout using the liquid handling platform, add manual sequences, import the libraries, then BAM! From there, I can develop the protocol using new submethods. 

A few of my projects include:
-LIMS tracking
-BeadPool Manufacturing
-Infinium pharmacogenetics assay
  -feasibility
-Troubleshooting and maintenance
-Creating test protocols
-Nighthawk, Razorfish+, and Excalibur assays

My experience with Lab Management includes:
-Equipment onboarding into Equipment Asset Maintainer (EAS)
-5S
-Equipment PQ/IQ/OQ
-Customer Service
