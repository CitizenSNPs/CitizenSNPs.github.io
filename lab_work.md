Working in lab management, I had the benefit of managing, automating, and working with a host of laboratory equipment. My experience includes, but is not limited to, Tecan EVO, Hamilton Star, Cybio FeliX, and the Agilent 2100 BioAnalyzer. I've attended onsite liquid-handling training for the Hamilton STAR, STARlet, and STARplus, as well as online training for the TecanEVO. I have experience scripting several microarray assays, including Illumina's Infinium and pharmacogenetics assays on both the Tecan and Hamilton STAR.

A few of my projects include:
-LIMS tracking
-BeadPool Manufacturing
-Infinium pharmacogenetics assay
  -feasibility
-Troubleshooting and maintenance
-Creating test protocols
-Nighthawk, Razorfish+, and Excalibur assays

My experience with Lab Management includes:
-Equipment onboarding
-5S
-Equipment PQ/IQ/OQ
-Customer Service
