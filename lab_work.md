Working in lab management, I had the benefit of managing, automating, and working with a host of laboratory equipment. My experience includes, but is not limited to, Tecan EVO, Hamilton Star, Cybio FeliX, and the Agilent 2100 BioAnalyzer. I've attended onsite liquid-handling training for the Hamilton STAR, STARlet, and STARplus, as well as online training for the TecanEVO. I have experience scripting several microarray assays, including Illumina's Infinium and pharmacogenetics assays.
