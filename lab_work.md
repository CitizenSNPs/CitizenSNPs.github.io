Working in lab management, I had the benefit of managing, automating, and working with a host of laboratory equipment. My experience includes, but is not limited to, Tecan EVO, Hamilton Star, Cybio FeliX, and the Agilent 2100 BioAnalyzer. I've attended onsite liquid-handling training for the Hamilton STAR, STARlet, and STARplus, as well as online training for the TecanEVO, and received certifications for both. I have experience scripting several microarray assays, including Illumina's Infinium and pharmacogenetics assays on both the Tecan and Hamilton STAR. My process includes buidling requirements to fit the needs of lab users. This invlolves quite a bit of offline testing and parameter tracking. I create a deck layout using the liquid handling platform, add manual sequences, import the libraries, then BAM! From there, I can develop the protocol using new submethods and push any tracked data to the LIMS. Sequence data can be tracked and edited; I can then modularize my workflows for a subsequent import.

A few of my projects include:</br>
-LIMS tracking</br>
-BeadPool Manufacturing</br>
-Infinium pharmacogenetics assay</br>
  -feasibility</br>
-Troubleshooting and maintenance</br>
-Creating test protocols</br>
-Nighthawk, Razorfish+, and Excalibur assays</br>


I attended the Eppendorf Automation Summit in 2019. There I learned several lab-based platforms to fit various user needs. Using this knowledge, I led a project in late 2020 to automate Illumina's sample prep sequencing platform via the Cybio FeliX. I also attended a 2021 Webinar on the challenges and developments in the vaccine industry and its role in process development.
